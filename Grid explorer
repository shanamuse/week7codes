The player starts at (0, 0)...
Player at (0, 0) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (0, 1) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (0, 2) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (0, 3) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (0, 4) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (0, 5) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-1, 5) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-2, 5) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-3, 5) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-4, 5) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-4, 4) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
Player at (-4, 3) - move N,S,E,W (q to quit)?
The player ends at (-4, 3)
